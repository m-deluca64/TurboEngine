**AISystem.cpp**
- contains snippets from the original file showing off the specific behaviors for a Combat Behavior Tree.
- Contains a simple AStar algorithm that uses navigation data generated from Recast/Detour to find and generate a path. Currently under development
- Behavior Tree Nodes include:
	- Move To - the steering behavior
	- MoveToPath - the parent behavior to pop goals off a path
	- FindWalkablePoint  - given a target location, finds the nearest point on the navigation mesh
	- Find Random Walkable Point - finds a random point on the navigation mesh that the agent can reach
	- FindPath - the behavior that makes the pathing request and sets its result to the agent's blackboard
	- CanSeeTank - a decorator that checks if another tank is in the agent's sight range
	- FacePlayer - behavior to slerp the agen't rotation to face a player/target
	- FindPointAroundTarget - behavior to find a walkable point around a targeted agent
	- ObstacleAvoidance - steering behavior to avoid obstacles not represented through the navigation mesh.
